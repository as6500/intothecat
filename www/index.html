            <h1>Into The Cat</h1>
            Into the Cat is a 1v1 turn-based tactical strategy game for web browsers. 
            In the game players face each other in a grid like map where the objective is to kill the other player. 
            Each player can control 2 pieces, a weaker one that needs to be protected (the â€˜Mind-Catâ€™) and a stronger one that does most of the attacking (the â€˜Machine-Catâ€™). 
            The game ends when the playerâ€™s health reaches zero, and because both pawnâ€™s lives are interconnected, 
            dealing damage to the Machine-Cat means that you are also dealing some minor damage to the Mind-Cat.

            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            The game starts with each player on oposite sides of the board and you take turns moving around the board and attempting to hit each other with attacks. 
            <br> <br>
            You can only move and attack once with each pawn. 
            <br> <br>
            In order to move you click on your desired piece then the tile path you want it to take, then confirm. If the path is allowed it shall do it.
            <br> <br>
            In order to attack you click on your desired piece then on the bottom left a attack button will appear, if you click on it then you may point your attack up, down, left or right.

            if you ever feel like you dont want to either move or attack anymore this turn you may skip your turn at anytime on the top left.
